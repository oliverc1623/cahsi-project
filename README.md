# Cahsi Project

Applying LoRA to efficiently fine-tune SAM on covid-19 chest x-rays. 

## TODOs:
- [ ] Apply LoRA to all MLP layers
- [ ] Finetune Vision encoder, in addition to mask decoder
- [ ] Apply LoRA to LayerNorm layers
- [ ] Fine-tune on entire dataset
- [ ] Add validation set to check overfitting
