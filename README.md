### Questions:
- Why did we apply `ResizeLongestSide` for batched inference?
- Why did batch boxes use `apply_boxes_torch`?

### Questions:
- Why are the MedSAM pretrained parameters a lot smaller compared to SA's?
- Why are text prompts for medsam and sam not publically or readily available?
- Why did Adapter(H) increase in validation accruracy as trainable parameters increased?
    - Why are the other algorithms performing poorly? Are they overfitting?
- Since we've been tasked to read SAM, MedSAM, and LoRA are you going to try to leverage LoRA for efficient transfer learning of segmentation models?

### Weekly meeting: 
TODO: 
- Read efficientSAM, CLIP
- Run examples with efficientSAM
- LoRA: understand code, COLAB pro can get by
- Github link on slack https://github.com/HUANGLIZI/LViT?tab=readme-ov-file
